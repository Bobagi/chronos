# CLAUDE.md — Cartomania (internal name: Chronos)

> **BRANDING:** the product is branded **Cartomania** (the user-facing name + the GitHub repo
> `Bobagi/cartomania`); it's meant to host multiple collections (Dracomania, Mythomania, custom
> player collections). The **codebase identifiers** (`Chronos*` functions/types, the `chronos` proxy
> path), the **domain** (`chronos.bobagi.space`), and the **infra** names (Docker `chronos-*`, PM2
> `chronos-web`, the DB) still use `chronos` on purpose — so "Chronos" below = the internal/infra name.

## What Chronos is

A digital collectible card game (the **Dracomania** collection — dragons & fantasy), built as
the owner's (Gustavo Perin / "Bobagi") portfolio piece. It is **one project**:

- **Backend** — NestJS game engine at the repo root (`src/`), Prisma + Postgres. Runs in Docker.
- **Frontend** — SvelteKit app in `web/` (`@sveltejs/adapter-node`). Talks to the backend
  **server-side** via a proxy (`/api/chronos/*`), so the browser only hits its own origin (no CORS).

The former separate `kairos` frontend was merged into `web/` and retired. Repo:
`https://github.com/Bobagi/chronos`. Live: `https://chronos.bobagi.space`.

The main mode is **Attribute Duel** (`mode = ATTRIBUTE_DUEL`): each round both duelists reveal one
card and clash on one attribute (**magic / might / fire**); the round winner captures both cards into
their discard pile; whoever captured more cards when a hand empties wins the match. There's a legacy
`CLASSIC` mode too, but Attribute Duel is the focus.

## Runtime / deploy reality (confirmed on the VPS)

| Part | Where | How it runs | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `/opt/chronos/web` (`build/index.js`) | **PM2** app `chronos-web` | 127.0.0.1:**3055** |
| Backend | Docker `chronos-backend` (image `chronos-chronos`) | `docker compose` service `chronos` | host **3056** → container 3000; also 5555 (Prisma Studio) |
| Database | Docker `chronos-db` (postgres:15) | `docker compose` service `db` | host **5434** → 5432 |
| nginx | `/etc/nginx/sites-available/chronos.bobagi.space` | proxies `/` → 127.0.0.1:3055 | :80/:443 |

- **Node is 18.20.5 via nvm; pnpm 9.15.9.** (`.nvmrc` says 20 but only 18 is installed.) The web build
  needs `npm_config_engine_strict=false` to tolerate that.
- Card art is served from `https://bobagi.space/images/cards/<number>.png`
  (backend prepends `CARD_IMAGE_BASE_URL`, default `https://bobagi.space`, in `CardRepository`).
- **Card font split:** `web/static/fonts/Morpheus.ttf` (family `'Morpheus'`) is used for all in-card
  text — title banner name, card number, and attribute values. `web/static/fonts/ExocetHeavy.ttf`
  (family `'Draco'`, real Exocet Heavy by Barnbrook/Emigre) is kept ONLY for the attribute labels
  (MAGIC / MIGHT / FIRE). Both are declared in `web/src/routes/game/fonts.css`. The UI/nav font
  (`--font-display: 'Draco'`) in `appShell.css` is unchanged (Exocet stays for the top bar, etc.).
- **Card aspect ratio is 1444/1920** (the designer frame dimensions, ≈ 0.752). All CSS and
  `aspectWidth`/`aspectHeight` defaults in `CardComposite`, `DeckStack`, `hands.css`, `flip.css`,
  `effects.css`, `galleryPage.css`, `mainpage.css` and `cards-lab` use this ratio. The old 430/670
  was wrong (too tall).

### Deploy the FRONTEND (after editing anything in `web/`)
```bash
cd /opt/chronos/web
bash -lc 'source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh; export npm_config_engine_strict=false; pnpm run build'   # ~10-18s
pm2 restart chronos-web --update-env && pm2 save
```
PM2 serves the built `build/` — **you must rebuild + restart** for changes to show. CSS/markup-only
changes don't need anything else.

### Deploy the BACKEND (after editing anything in `src/`, `prisma/`)
```bash
cd /opt/chronos
docker compose build chronos          # nest build runs inside node:20 (no nvm needed)
docker compose up -d chronos           # recreate; waits for db healthy; re-runs idempotent seed
# wait for health:
curl -s http://localhost:3056/health   # -> {"status":"ok",...}
```
Source formatting changes alone don't require a backend rebuild (compiled behavior is identical).

## Architecture gotchas (important — learned the hard way)

- **Duel center shape mismatch.** The backend persists/returns the duel center with INTERNAL keys
  (`playerACardCode`, `playerBCardCode`, `roundWinnerId`, `isRevealed`, `playerAAttributeValue`…),
  but the UI uses the PUBLIC shape (`aCardCode`, `bCardCode`, `roundWinner`, `revealed`, `aVal`,
  `bVal`). The duel page normalizes via `normalizeDuelCenterForView` (in `web/src/lib/duel/duelCenter.ts`).
  If you touch duel-center fields, keep both ends in sync.
- **serialize/deserialize keys must match.** In `src/game/game.types.ts`, `serializeDuelCenter` and
  `deserializeDuelCenter` must read/write the SAME keys. A past bug read `roundWinner` while writing
  `roundWinnerId`, so every round scored as a draw and matches were unwinnable. Deserialize now reads
  `roundWinnerId` (with `roundWinner` fallback).
- **Server-authoritative duel progression.** The duel state machine lives entirely on the server
  (`duel-game.service.ts`). `DuelProgressionService` (`duel-progression.service.ts`) is a
  `@nestjs/schedule` `@Interval(1500)` loop that calls `DuelGameService.progressDueDuel(gameId)` for
  every active `ATTRIBUTE_DUEL` (`winner` null, `duelStage` ≠ `RESOLVED`): when a turn's deadline (or
  the REVEAL hold) elapses it auto-resolves/advances it exactly like a timeout — **so a match keeps
  going and finishes even with no browser open** (it stops "pausing" when a player leaves the screen).
  Each step is stage-guarded inside its own transaction, so it never double-resolves even if an open
  client acts at the same time. The server steps in just AFTER the per-turn deadline
  (`SERVER_PICK_GRACE_MS = 1_500`, a small latency buffer) and holds REVEAL `SERVER_REVEAL_HOLD_MS =
  4_800` (long enough for the flip/defeat animation). Requires `ScheduleModule.forRoot()` in
  `app.module.ts`.
- **The duel client is a pure renderer — it does NOT drive the game.** `CLIENT_DRIVES_TIMEOUTS = false`
  in the duel page: the client never auto-picks on timeout and never calls `advance` (that logic is
  kept behind the flag for local debugging only). Instead it **polls `GET state` every
  `STATE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS = 1000`** and renders whatever the server returns, so it reflects the
  server's own timeouts/advances and (in PvP) the opponent's moves. It still sends the player's real
  moves over REST (`choose card/attribute`, surrender) — which the server validates — so a hacked
  client can't stall a match or fake the clock; the server enforces everything. **Gotcha:** because the
  reveal block re-runs on every poll, the flip/defeat animation is gated on a `previousDuelStage`
  transition (only fires when the stage actually enters `REVEAL`), and the hand is reconciled
  (`reconcile()` keeps existing card uids) so polling never re-animates or flickers. The `now`
  interval (250ms) is now display-only (the countdown). `TURN_DURATION_MS = 10_000` is the server's
  per-turn deadline. (Possible future polish: swap polling for the WS gateway `game` namespace —
  handlers already emit `state` to room `game:<id>`; would need an nginx `location /socket.io/` →
  `:3056` and a socket.io-client.)
- **Game routes are chromeless.** `+layout.svelte` hides the global TopBar/footer on `/game/*`; the
  board owns the viewport (`height: 100dvh`, no page scroll). Card sizes are viewport-height based so
  both hands + the battlefield fit one screen; the battle log scrolls inside its own panel.
- **Duel stacking order.** The fanned hand cards carry `z-index` up to ~999 (on hover) and fan upward
  into the center, so any interactive center-zone UI must sit above them. The attribute picker
  (`.notice.chooser` in `game/notices.css`) is `position: relative; z-index: 1600` for exactly this —
  without it the picker renders behind the hand and its buttons are unclickable.
- **Duel board layout = the designer's "mesa".** The board is `.lb` (in `duelBoardLayout.css`): the
  felt (`.lb__table`) fills the WHOLE viewport and everything else (opponent strip `.lb__opp`, hand+HUD
  strip `.lb__you`, log `.lb__log`, chooser `.lb__notices`) is an absolute OVERLAY on top — so the big
  card column is the focus and the hand sits on top at the bottom. The column uses
  `.lb__cards { flex-direction: column-reverse }` so the OPPONENT card shows on top while the
  binding-heavy YOUR-card markup stays first in source (slot A = `aCardCode` = you, slot B =
  `bCardCode` = opponent — don't swap those). In-play cards are sized in `vh` (`.lb__cards .duel-slot`
  ≈ `16vh`) and hand cards via `cardWidthCssValue` (≈ `15.5vh`); `.lb__table` reserves `8vh` top /
  `26vh` bottom so the column never collides with the strips. The chooser (`.lb__notices`,
  `z-index:1600`) sits just above the hand and stays clickable. The opponent hand is a small offset
  stack of card backs (`.lb__oparc-card`, no fan rotation) shown next to the score orbs, not a deck
  pile. The round-result banner is `.lb__round-banner` inside `.lb__column` (absolute `top:50%` = the
  VS) so it overlays the VS medallion instead of the player's card — note `.round-banner` is
  `position:fixed`, which is why it must NOT live under a `transform`ed ancestor like `.lb__notices`.
  Score orbs show an icon (`.orb-ic` trophy / card-stack SVG) + number with a `title` tooltip (no text
  label). The old `.zone`/`.fixed-top-bar` CSS is unused; cards/flip/chooser/endscreen and
  `.hand.my-hand.fan` are unchanged. A **layout toggle** (`.lb__layout-toggle` by the player HUD)
  adds `.lb--side-hand` to `.lb`: the hand becomes a vertical column on the right rail, the log moves
  to the left, and the battlefield cards grow (persisted in `localStorage['duel-side-hand']`).
- **CardComposite title = elastic 3-slice banner** (`/frames/title-{left,mid,right}.png`): fixed caps +
  a middle that STRETCHES with the name (anchored RIGHT, so long names grow the ribbon leftward like the
  printed cards). The stretch is **pure CSS** (flexbox) — keep it that way. The card number rides in the
  right ornament (`.cc-num`); name/number outlines are text-shadows. A name only shrinks if it overflows
  the max-width ribbon: a **synchronous, bounded** `fitBannerName()` lowers a CSS `--name-shrink`
  multiplier (so the name still scales with the card), run from `afterUpdate` (guarded by
  `nameEl.dataset.fitted`, only on real name changes) + once on `fonts.ready`. Banner CSS vars:
  `--cc-banner-h/top/right/min`, `--cc-name-factor`, `--cc-num-factor`, `--cc-num-x/y`.
  **PITFALL (this caused real "page not responding" freezes on every card page):** never drive the fit
  from an `async`/`await tick()` reactive or a `ResizeObserver` on the card — the flex-grow middle + an
  observer feed back into an infinite layout loop. Keep it synchronous + observer-free.
- **Hand-hover selection glow is green** (Hearthstone-style, `hands.css`); the elliptical golden pedestal
  under the lifted card was removed.
- **Other card text is tunable via CSS vars** (`web/src/routes/game/fonts.css`): `--cc-text-color`,
  `--cc-val-size`/`--cc-val-ls`, `--cc-label-size`/`--cc-label-ls` (all default to the current look).
  All outlines are **text-shadows** (8-direction), NOT `-webkit-text-stroke` (which thinned glyphs).
  Tune in `/cards-lab` and bake into `fonts.css` + `CardComposite` defaults.
- **Friend API paths live in the client factory DEFAULTS** (`web/src/lib/api/chronosClientFactory.ts`,
  `defaultClientOptions`). They must match the NestJS controllers: `POST /friends/request/:id/{accept,
  reject}`, `DELETE /friends/:id`, `POST /game/start-with-friend`. A past bug had wrong defaults
  (`/friends/respond`, `/friends/remove`, `/friends/start`) that the browser client used → "Cannot POST
  /friends/respond" when accepting a request. Both clients now rely on the (correct) defaults.
- **Responsive landing title.** The brand hero title is sized with container-query units
  (`.hero-title { font-size: clamp(34px, 10.5cqw, 82px) }`, with `.landing-hero { container-type:
  inline-size }`) so the long word "CARTOMANIA" always fits one line; the auth column is a fixed
  `minmax(300px, 360px)`. The top bar shrinks the brand on phones and hides the brand text below 430px.
- **CardComposite is sized with container-query units.** Its root sets `container-type:size`, so
  inner sizes/fonts use `cqh`/`cqw` and scale with the card. Don't size card text in `px` or via
  `inherit` from the root — a past bug left the corner number on `font-size:var(--corner-number-font-cqh)`
  (undefined) plus `.card-corner-number { font-size: inherit !important }`, so it didn't grow in the
  enlarged gallery modal. Size such elements with a `cqh` value on the element itself.
- **Gallery card modal** (`web/src/lib/styles/routes/galleryPage.css`): the enlarged card is sized by
  **height** (`min(72vh, 600px)` + `aspect-ratio`) so the whole dialog never scrolls; the detail panel
  uses the real power icons (`/icons/{magic,strength,fire}_icon.png`), not emoji.
- **i18n is a small custom store** (`web/src/lib/i18n`). It exposes a `locale` store and a reactive
  `$t('a.b.c', vars)` translator (dotted keys, `{var}` interpolation, English fallback so missing
  strings never crash). The server resolves the locale in `hooks.server.ts` (cookie `chronos_locale`
  → `Accept-Language` → default `en`), puts it on `locals.locale` + layout `data.locale`, and
  `+layout.svelte` calls `initLocale(data.locale)` so SSR renders the chosen language; `app.html` uses
  `<html lang="%lang%">` (replaced in the hook). `setLocale()` (the header `LanguageSelector`) updates
  the store + cookie + `<html lang>`. To add a string: add the key to **all three** `locales/*.ts`
  (en is the canonical shape) and use `$t('...')`. For non-string values (objects/arrays) use the
  `$td('key')` getter — the `/privacy` + `/terms` pages are data-driven: each doc is a structured
  `legal.{privacy,terms}` object (title/intro/sections/items) rendered by the shared
  `LegalDocument.svelte`. **All UI is translated** (top bar, footer, home, gallery + modal, register,
  duel board + battle log, friends panel, legal pages).
- **Card content (name/description) is localized via a normalized `CardTranslation` table** (base `Card`
  keeps canonical English; one row per `(cardId, locale)` for pt/es; seeded idempotently). ONLY the
  collection-cards endpoint localizes: `GET /game/collections/:id/cards` reads the locale from
  `?locale=` or the `x-chronos-locale` header (the web proxy sets it from the locale cookie), so the
  **gallery** is localized with zero per-call threading. `getAllCards`/`findByCode` (the `/game/cards`
  paths the duel uses) stay **canonical** on purpose — the duel + server battle-log lines need English
  names so the log's name→code parsing keeps working. The logged-out hero (SSR, direct to backend, no
  proxy header) also stays canonical.
- **Google sign-in is scaffolded, not live.** Frontend only so far: a `GoogleAuthButton` on the login
  card + register page, plus SvelteKit endpoints `web/src/routes/auth/google/+server.ts` (consent
  redirect) and `.../callback/+server.ts` (stub). It comes to life once these are set:
    - `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED=true` (web — shows/enables the button; otherwise it shows "coming soon")
    - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` (web server — the OAuth client;
      redirect URI e.g. `https://chronos.bobagi.space/auth/google/callback`)
  Still TODO (documented inline in the callback): the token exchange, `id_token` verification, a backend
  find-or-create-Player-by-Google-identity endpoint (needs a `googleId`/`email` column on Player via a
  Prisma migration), then `setChronosSessionCookie`.
- **Prettier:** the repo's `prettier-plugin-svelte` crashes on Prettier **3.8** (`getVisitorKeys`).
  Format with a compatible version: `npx --yes prettier@3.6.2 --write .` (run inside `web/` and at the
  repo root). `web/pnpm-lock.yaml` is untracked by design — don't commit it.

## Verifying changes

- **API smoke (fast, no browser):** start a duel, choose a card, choose the winning attribute:
  ```bash
  ADMIN=$(docker exec chronos-db psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -t -A -c \
    "SELECT id FROM \"Player\" WHERE username='admin'")   # (load .env first)
  GID=$(curl -s -XPOST localhost:3056/game/start-duel -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"playerAId\":\"$ADMIN\"}" | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["gameId"])')
  curl -s localhost:3056/game/state/$GID            # inspect duelStage + duelCenter
  ```
- **Browser (Playwright is installed, chromium headless):** drive `https://chronos.bobagi.space` or
  navigate directly to `/game/duel/<id>` (state fetch + duel actions are unauthenticated) and
  screenshot. Import via `createRequire('/opt/chronos/web/')('playwright')`.

## Conventions & rules

- **Don't reset the database** (default). It's seeded (idempotent) with the Dracomania collection
  (32 cards + their pt/es `CardTranslation` rows) and users `admin` (ADMIN) / `alice`. Adding the
  translations was an additive migration (`20260608000000_add_card_translations`) — `migrate deploy`
  + seed on a normal `docker compose up` applied it with no wipe. Creating throwaway test games/users is fine; they age out (admin
  "Expire old games" button) — but direct DB mutations are restricted, so prefer the app's own endpoints.
- **Secrets:** `.env` (backend) and `web/.env` hold DB creds / API base. Never print, echo, or commit them.
- **Don't touch other VPS services** (rhyme, umami, todo, etc.) — see `/root/CLAUDE.md` for the machine map.
- **Commits:** end messages with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Work on
  `main` (current convention) or `feat/*`; confirm before destructive git/DB actions.

## Status (update as you go)

- **Server-authoritative duel** (anti-cheat): `DuelProgressionService` drives every active duel to
  completion on its own (`@nestjs/schedule`), so a match continues & finishes even with no browser open;
  the client is a pure renderer (polls state, `CLIENT_DRIVES_TIMEOUTS=false`, only sends real moves).
- **Card FX** (designer handoff in `web/src/lib/cards`): holographic foil tilt-shine + burn/dissolve/
  crush destruction, strictly confined to the card. The duel round-loss effect is now the destruction
  (fire→burn, magic→dissolve, might→crush via `playDuelDestruction` on the losing card). Tune everything
  at **`/cards-lab`** and Export the JSON; baked-in defaults live in `cardDestruction.ts` / `holoTilt.ts`.
- Attribute Duel is fully playable end-to-end (the round-winner bug is fixed; matches resolve a winner).
- Whole-app UI redesign done (dark-fantasy gold theme): landing/login, dashboard, friends modal,
  gallery, and the single-screen duel board with a scrollable battle log and Hearthstone-style hand
  hover highlight.
- Backend follows NestJS layered architecture (modules/services/repositories/DTOs/guards); the duel
  page was decomposed into `web/src/lib/duel/*` modules.
- The logged-out landing hero now renders the actual in-game cards (CardComposite, SSR'd) instead of
  bare art tiles; the footer's Privacy/Terms links resolve to real `/privacy` and `/terms` pages.
- Account management: clickable profile avatar → picker (curated card art + a `web/static/avatars/`
  folder for custom images); an `/account` page to change username / password / delete the account.
  The `/api/auth/{avatar,username}` web endpoints re-set the `chronos_session` cookie with the updated
  user (so SSR stays in sync); `/api/auth/delete` clears it. Player has an `avatarUrl` column.
- Multilanguage (en / pt / es) with a flag language selector in the top bar; persisted via cookie and
  SSR-resolved. The whole UI is translated, and **card name/description are localized in the gallery**
  via the `CardTranslation` table (the duel keeps canonical English by design — see the gotcha).
- **Friends panel z-index fixed**: backdrop z-index raised to 200 (was 40, behind top-bar at 50); dock
  → 210, toast → 220 so they all float above the top bar correctly on desktop and mobile.
- **Card outline**: 8-direction text-shadow controlled via `--cc-outline-size` (fraction of banner height,
  default 0.028) and `--cc-outline-color` (default `#000`). Both are now live CSS vars, so `/cards-lab`
  can tune and export them. The `.cc-banner` rule defines `--osh` and `--oc` shorthands inherited by
  `.cc-name` and `.cc-num`.
- **`/cards-lab` controls**: non-working sliders (`Attr outline base`, `Attr value/label outline`)
  removed; `Outline color` picker now wired to `--cc-outline-color`; new `Outline thickness` slider for
  `--cc-outline-size`; `Number size` min lowered to 0.08.
- **Challenge notification**: the dashboard polls `GET /game/active/mine` every 4 s; when a new game
  appears where the current user is playerB (challenger ≠ BOT) and the game wasn't known before, a
  `.challenge-toast` floats at the bottom with Accept → navigate to game and Decline → surrender. First
  poll silently seeds `seenGameIds` (localStorage key `cartomania-seen-games`) so existing games never
  trigger a spurious notification. Friends are cached in `friendsCache` (Map id→username) for the name
  display. Chat via the floating dock in FriendsPanel already works end-to-end (`fetchChronosFriendChat`
  / `sendChronosFriendMessage`).
