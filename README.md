# Chronos â€“ Mythological Card Game Engine (Backend)

**Chronos** is the backend engine for a multiplayer online card game inspired by mythology and classic battle card mechanics (inspired by Dracomania). This service handles all game rules, player logic, turn rotation, card resolution, and battle flow.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) â€“ backend framework (TypeScript)
- REST API + Swagger for testing
- Future support: WebSocket for real-time interaction
- Deployment: GitHub Codespaces / Docker-ready

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Create and manage a match between 2 players
- Track game state, logs, turns, and HP
- Play cards via text commands (easily testable via `curl`)
- REST endpoints for game actions
- Swagger docs available at `/api`

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (Codespaces)

1. Open this repo in GitHub Codespaces  
2. Run the NestJS app:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
3. Make port `3000` public in Codespaces

## ðŸ§ª Testing the API

> Replace `<URL>` with your Codespaces domain (e.g. `https://animated-bassoon-jqq44xj75qwfqw4g-3000.app.github.dev`)

### âœ… Test the server

```bash
curl -k <URL>/game/test
```

### ðŸŽ® Start a new game
